# Speech-Signal-Modulation
Speech Signal modulation using matlab </br>
It is required to modulate three speech signals using the following scheme:</br>
s(t)=x_1 (t)  cos⁡〖ω_1 t〗  +x_2 (t)  cos⁡〖ω_2 t〗+x_3 (t)  sin⁡〖ω_2 t〗
and then perform synchronous demodulation.</br></br>
Select reasonable values for ω_1, ω_2 and any required parameters.</br></br>
<ol>
  <li>	Obtain the modulated signal. Plot it in time domain. Plot its magnitude spectrum.
  <li>	Perform synchronous demodulation to restore the three signals.

  <li>	Perform demodulation three times with phase shifts of 10, 30, 90 degrees for both carriers.
  <li>For x_1 (t), perform demodulation two times with a local carrier frequency that is different by 2 Hz and 10 Hz from its carrier frequency.
